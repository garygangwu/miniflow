# MiniFlow: A simplified TensorFlow
MiniFlow implements a simple but core functionality of the TensorFlow. This is my course project for Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree Program

## Overview
It contains a basic neural network library with the core features, such as linear transformation, sigmoid, backpropagation, and gradient descent.
